Install and Run Instructions:
   -------------------
##Install TextBlob library
   
###Ensure Python is installed on your system.

####Run the Python script `sentiment_analysis.py` using any Python interp:

#####Code Explanation:
-----------------
######The `analyze_sentiment()` function (lines 4-17) takes a text input and analyzes the sentiment of each sentence using the TextBlob library.

#######Inside the function, it iterates over each sentence in the text, calculates its sentiment polarity, and prints whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral based on the polarity.

########Important areas of the code include:
- Importing TextBlob library (line 1).
- Defining the `analyze_sentiment()` function with a docstring explaining its purpose and usage.
- The control flow statement (`if`, `elif`, `else`) used to determine sentiment and print corresponding messages.
  
Final Thoughts/Future Thoughts

One suggestion, if requested to utilize this package for another project, would be to create a tool for sentiment analysis on social network posts. The program may use TextBlob to analyze the sentiment of posts it finds on social media sites that are associated with particular subjects or keywords. Businesses and individuals may find this useful in tracking public opinion and sentiment around particular subjects or brands. Furthermore, by visualizing sentiment trends over time, the application could offer insightful information for public relations or marketing campaigns.
